<p>The harvesting phase is critical as it directly influences the fruit's post-harvest life and quality.</p> <br>
<p><b>Maturity Indexing for Non-Climacteric Fruit:</b></p> <br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Optimal Timing:</b> Dragon fruit is harvested at peak ripeness—30–32 days after flowering—by expert teams ensuring vibrant color and full size</li>
    <li><b>Visual & Sensory Assessment:</b> Each fruit is carefully checked for 70% uniform color, firmness, and slightly softened bracts</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Gentle Harvesting Technique:</b></p><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Sterilized Tools:</b> Harvesters use sterilized tools to cut the fruit, leaving 1–2 cm of stem attached to prevent rot and extend shelf life.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature-Controlled Harvesting: </b> Harvesting is done in the cooler early mornings or late afternoons to reduce field heat and slow post-harvest decay.</li>
    <li><b>Immediate Field Protection:</b> Harvested fruits are promptly placed in clean, padded, ventilated crates, avoiding sun, dust, and contaminants to prevent bruising or damage.</li>
